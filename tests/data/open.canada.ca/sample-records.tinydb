However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species\u2019 recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (\u201cbiophysical attributes\u201d) that complete the definition of a species\u2019 critical habitat.\n\nEach species\u2019 dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cproposed\u201d critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. \u201cProposed\u201d critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term \u201cfinal\u201d, it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as \u201cgrid squares\u201d. These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species\u2019 recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. \n\nCritical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as \u201cthe habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species\u2019 critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species\u201d. Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic \u201cprotection\u201d designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection.",

However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species\u2019 recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (\u201cbiophysical attributes\u201d) that complete the definition of a species\u2019 critical habitat.\n\nEach species\u2019 dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cproposed\u201d critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. \u201cProposed\u201d critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term \u201cfinal\u201d, it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as \u201cgrid squares\u201d. These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species\u2019 recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. \n\nCritical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as \u201cthe habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species\u2019 critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species\u201d. Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic \u201cprotection\u201d designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection.",

However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species\u2019 recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (\u201cbiophysical attributes\u201d) that complete the definition of a species\u2019 critical habitat.\n\nEach species\u2019 dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cproposed\u201d critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. \u201cProposed\u201d critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term \u201cfinal\u201d, it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as \u201cgrid squares\u201d. These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species\u2019 recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. \n\nCritical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as \u201cthe habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species\u2019 critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species\u201d. Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic \u201cprotection\u201d designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection.",
