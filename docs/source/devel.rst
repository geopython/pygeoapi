OSX Developers
==============

Using pyenv
-----------

It is common among OSX developers to use the package manager homebrew for the installation of pyenv to being able to manage multiple versions of Python.
They can encounter errors about the load of some SQLite extensions that pygeoapi uses for handling spatial data formats. In order to run properly the server
you are required to follow these steps below carefully.

Make Homebrew and pyenv play nicely together::

.. code-block:: console

    # see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/106
    alias brew='env PATH=${PATH//$(pyenv root)\/shims:/} brew'

Install python with the option to enable SQLite extensions::

.. code-block:: console

    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib -L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include -I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include" PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions" pyenv install 3.7.6

Configure SQLite from Homebrew over that one shipped with the OS::

.. code-block:: console

    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"

Install Spatialite from Homebrew::

.. code-block:: console

    brew update
    brew install spatialite-tools
    brew libspatialite

Set the variable for the Spatialite library under OSX::

.. code-block:: console

    SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib
