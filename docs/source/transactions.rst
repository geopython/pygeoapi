Transactions
============

pygeoapi supports the `OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete`_ draft specification, allowing
for transactional capabilities against feature and record data.

To enable transactions in pygeoapi, a given resource provider needs to be editable (via the configuration resource provider
``editable: true`` property).  Note that the feature or record provider MUST support create/update/delete.  See the
:ref:`ogcapi-features` and :ref:`ogcapi-records` documentation for transaction support status of pygeoapi backends.

Access control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be made clear that authentication and authorization is beyond the responsibility of pygeoapi.  This means that
if a pygeoapi user enables transactions, they must provide access control explicity via another service.
