  Filters the indoorFeatures, thematicLayer, and primalSpace content by a specific floor level.
  
  **Filtering Logic:**
  * **Primal Space:** The filter is explicitly applied to `CellSpace` geometries on the specified level (e.g., '1F', 'B1').
  * **Inferred Members:** Other members of the Primal and Dual spaces (e.g., boundaries, nodes, edges) are automatically included based on their relationships (`boundedBy`, `duality`) with the selected CellSpaces.
  
  **Note:** If both this parameter or `bbox` is omitted, the response will return **metadata only** to reduce payload size.
